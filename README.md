# Tech-Base2
This is something I made as an intern at Tech-Base. It is an application for mahjong circles and mahjong parlors to keep track of scores. Users can set a room name and password, and an administrator password to easily share the information with friends who know the password.

# Future Prospects
In the future, we would like to improve this application to make it more user-friendly.

There is also a possibility that I will release the service when it is completed.
